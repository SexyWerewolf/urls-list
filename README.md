# URLs List Addon - Enhanced Version

This repository is a fork of the original [URLs List addon](https://github.com/moritz-h/urls-list), which allows you to list the URLs of all open tabs in the current window as copyable plaintext. This enhanced version includes an additional feature that remembers and automatically applies the last used filter input across sessions.

## New Feature

### Remember Filter Input

- **What's New:** The addon now remembers the filter input you set during your last session. When you close and reopen the addon, it will automatically restore the filter, allowing for a more seamless experience.

## Features

- **Copy URLs:** Easily copy all the URLs from your current window.
- **Filter URLs:** Use the filter function to narrow down the list of URLs to match specific patterns.
- **Sort URLs:** Sort URLs alphabetically in ascending or descending order.
- **Open URLs:** Open URLs from the list that aren't already open in your browser.
- **Save URLs:** Save the list of URLs to a file for later use.

## Installation

To install the enhanced version of the addon:

1. Download the addon from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/) or directly from this repository.
2. Open your Firefox browser and navigate to `about:debugging`.
3. Click on "This Firefox" on the left panel.
4. Click on "Load Temporary Add-on...".
5. Select the `manifest.json` file from the downloaded directory.

## Usage

1. Click on the URLs List icon in your browser toolbar.
2. Use the filter box to narrow down the URLs.
3. Close and reopen the addon; your last filter will be automatically applied.
